      <p>This page is about how we can use the Sun's position, and earth's rotation to plot the paths of shadows over the course of an year. By printing these paths on a paper and aligning it with North-South direction, we can tell the time from shadows (~5min precision on an A4 sheet). <br>
      	This also includes Matlab code, so you can plot your own sundial in few mins.
