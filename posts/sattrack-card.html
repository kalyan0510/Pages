      <p> Earth Imaging satellites are put in Low Earth Orbits to make better observsations. But because of this, these satellites have only small section of Earth's surface cover their entire field of view, due to which they can only be in contact with a ground station for few minutes. Lets see how satellites points their antenna towards Ground Communication Station.  </p>
