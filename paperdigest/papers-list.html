    <a href="/paperdigest/saot.html">Saliency-Associated Object Tracking</a>
    <p>A new part-based object tracking strategy is proposed. It kind of uses attention between parts to produce rich features. A graph structure is made from saliency-associations and is processed by a GCN to output global correlation-representations.</p>
